# SVN #

You may also get the files through SVN, see the "Source" tab above.

There are various revisions that you can use to compare between the original AeroQuad or MultiWiiCopter source code with the new Ro4Copter source code that is derived from the original source code. You can use Google Code's diff tool to see compare these changes online, or use an offline too if you wish. To do this, see NewsUpdatesHistory. For an example of what I mean, see [this link here](http://code.google.com/p/ro-4-copter/source/diff?spec=svn108&r=108&format=side&path=/trunk/Ro4Copter_MultiWiiCopter/Ro4Copter_MultiWiiCopter.pde) and also [this link here](http://code.google.com/p/ro-4-copter/source/detail?r=108).
