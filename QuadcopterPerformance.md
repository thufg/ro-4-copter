## Motor Thrust ##

Looking at the data from the motor performance chart, it looks like the absolute maximum weight the motors can support is 560 each, so 2240 grams. This is when the motors are working at 100%, using 95.2 watts, which means about 8.6 amps at 11.1 volts.

Looking at the data from the flight weight vs power and battery life graph, it seems that the helicopter should not exceed 61 ounces (1700 grams). At that weight, 61 watts of power is used, which is 5.5 amps at 11.1 volts.

## Power Requirements ##

A graph depicting expected flight times is shown on [this forum thread](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=768115). Here is a [direct image link](http://www.af9y.com/PowerChart.jpg).

The graph also shows that one ounce of flight weight would need one watt of power, and the two are linearly correlated. Assuming the craft is 60 ounces, 60 watts of power is needed.

Assuming a 11.1V battery is used, this means the average current draw is roughly 5.4 amps.

Assuming a 7.4V battery is used (which is unlikely but possible), this means the average current draw is roughly 8.1 amps.
