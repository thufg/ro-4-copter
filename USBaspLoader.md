If you installed the components needed for the native USB connection, then you can use the USBaspLoader bootloader that I modified for Ro4Copter.

USBaspLoader is a bootloader that mimics a [USBasp AVR programmer](http://www.google.com/search?q=usbasp&btnI), visit its website to get the drivers you need for it.

[USBaspLoader material is found here](http://www.google.com/search?q=usbasploader&btnI)

USBaspLoader is based on [Objective Development's V-USB](http://obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html), which gives USB communication capabilities to AVR microcontrollers.
